![Build Image and Push to Dockerhub](https://github.com/bhudgens/aws-cli/workflows/Build%20Image%20and%20Push%20to%20Dockerhub/badge.svg)

### Why?

The default docker aws cli container doesn't seem to have the session manager plugin. I didn't see a tag with it installed. This installs it and pushed it to Dockerhub:

bhudgens/aws-cli
